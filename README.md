# About 

Better organize your time in FFXIV. This application is to help people who want to walk away from their computer or do other things while waiting for an in game time event to happen. The clock displayed represents the current in game time. By adding a event/task to the list with a time, you will be notified when the task/event is starting with a song playing. To stop the song simply click on the music note icon that appears next to the task.
